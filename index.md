I'm a second-year master's student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, co-advised by [Stephen Melczer](https://melczer.ca) and [Rafael Oliveira](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~r5olivei/). 

My research interests lie in algebraic and analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV), specifically constructive verification of coefficient positivity. I'm also interested in all things computer algebra, especially creative-telescoping methods for integration and the commutative algebra / real algebraic geometry that goes toward solving problems this area.

I completed bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in 2024. My senior thesis was concerned with automating aspects of asymptotic derivations for certain subclasses of rational functions using ACSV.
