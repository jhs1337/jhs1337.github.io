I'm a first-year master's student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie in algebraic complexity, algorithmic combinatorics, formalization and automated theorem proving.

I completed bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in 2024. My honors thesis concerned attempts at automating aspects of asymptotic derivations for certain subclasses of rational functions using analytic combinatorics in several variables.
