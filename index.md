I'm a second-year master's student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie in algebraic and analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV), specifically constructive verification of coefficient positivity. I'm also interested in all things computer algebra, including the commutative algebra and real algebraic geoemtry that goes along with it.

I completed bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in 2024. My honors thesis concerned attempts at automating aspects of asymptotic derivations for certain subclasses of rational functions using ACSV.
