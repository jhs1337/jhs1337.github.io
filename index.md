I'm a first-year master's student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Waterloo. My interests lie in complexity, algorithmic combinatorics, formalization and automated theorem proving.

I completed bachelor's degrees in both Mathematics and Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in 2024. My honors thesis concerned attempts at automating aspects of asymptotic derivations for certain subclasses of rational functions using analytic combinatorics in several variables.
